**Multilingual Text Detoxification with Parallel Data**

[![COLING2025](https://img.shields.io/badge/COLING%202025-b31b1b)](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.535/) 
[![CLEF2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLEF%202024-b31b1b)](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3740/paper-223.pdf) 

This is the multilingual parallel dataset for the text detoxification task. Prepared for TextDetox Shared Task. 

ðŸ“° **Updates**

**[2025]** The second edition of TextDetox shared task! [webpage](https://pan.webis.de/clef25/pan25-web/text-detoxification.html)

**[2025]** We extend our data to new languages! Now also included: Italian, French, Hebrew, Hinglish, Japanese, Tatar. Check our [test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/textdetox/multilingual_paradetox_test) part.

**[2025]** We dived into the explainability of our data in our new [COLING paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.11691)!

**[2024]** You can check additional releases for [Ukrainian ParaDetox](https://huggingface.co/datasets/textdetox/uk_paradetox) and [Spanish ParaDetox](https://huggingface.co/datasets/textdetox/es_paradetox) from NAACL 2024!

**[2024]** **April, 23rd, update: We are realsing the parallel train set! The test part for the final phase of the competition is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/textdetox/multilingual_paradetox_test)!!!**

**[2022]** You can also check previously created training corpora: [English ParaDetox](https://huggingface.co/datasets/s-nlp/paradetox) from ACL 2022 and [Russian ParaDetox](https://huggingface.co/datasets/s-nlp/ru_paradetox).

**[2022]** The first release for [CLEF TextDetox 2024](https://pan.webis.de/clef24/pan24-web/text-detoxification.html) shared task.
For each of 9 languages, we collected 1k pairs of toxic<->detoxified instances splitted into two parts: dev (400 pairs) and test (600 pairs).

One potential approach to address this challenge is automatic text detoxification, a text style transfer (TST) approach that transforms toxic language into a more neutral or non-toxic form. To date, the availability of parallel corpora for the text detoxification task (Logacheva et al., 2022; Atwell et al., 2022; Dementieva et al., 2024a) has proven to be crucial for state-of-the-art approaches. With this work, we extend parallel text detoxification corpus to new languages{---}German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Amharic{---}testing in the extensive multilingual setup TST baselines. Next, we conduct the first of its kind an automated, explainable analysis of the descriptive features of both toxic and non-toxic sentences, diving deeply into the nuances, similarities, and differences of toxicity and detoxification across 9 languages. Finally, based on the obtained insights, we experiment with a novel text detoxification method inspired by the Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning approach, enhancing the prompting process through clustering on relevant descriptive attributes."
